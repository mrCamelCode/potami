- Add a session module
  - Backed by Deno KV
    - Would allow in-memory and persisted info.
  - Sessions are useful for storing data between requests.
  - Should have:
    - A middleware that populates a `session` object on the `ctx`. Handles:
      - Automatically creating a session if one doesn't exist.
      - Periodically purging expired sessions from the DB?
        - Maybe this is a cron job? But then it's not as handy.
    - A type to use to extend the app's `ctx` type.
      - Type should be generic so that the user can specify what kind of data they put on their sessions in their app.
- Add a security module 
  - Would be a good place to move the CORS middleware to.
  - Could be a good place for middleware that parses something like JWTs.
- Allow a path matcher regex to be specified for middleware so that middleware can be restricted to only running for certain paths more easily.
  - Useful for more generic paths, i.e. "Only run my auth middleware on paths that match `/\/secured/`"
- Allow request handler middleware
  - Would be useful for middleware that runs only on a very specific route/handler. This would have one obvious use of role-based auth route guards.
  - The type of `RequestHandler` could be updated to expect EITHER:
    1. The funvtion signature it currently expects
    1. An array, where the first element is an array of middleware and the second argument is the function signature it currently expects.
